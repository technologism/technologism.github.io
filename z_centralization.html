									<h2><b>What happens:</b></h2>
									<p>Concentration of decision-making power, which is <a class="tooltip">dataflow<span class="tooltiptext">Information-gathering and processing</span></a> and imaginary power (authority), becoming more effective than disperson of power. Centralization is commonly associated with oppression, making the rise a concern. Not to be confused with: <a href="zz_centraltrend.html">Centralizing tendencies of technology</a>.</p>
									<h2><b>How it happens:</b></h2>
									<p><b>Problems with centralization:</b> Centralized systems have at large scales are usually less effective than decentralized systems. Notable relative weaknesses include: Laggy communication: Decisions made at a distance easily becomes obsolete during changing situations. Lack of processing power: Too much information compared to processing power and time means some will have to be skipped. This means less accurate depictions of reality are used in making decisions (which also are impacted by lower processing-power). Corruptability and bias: Individuals tend to be more corrupt and biased than collectives.</p>
									<p><b>Introduction of information technology:</b> Communication technologies like electric signals, encryption and decryption, and light-waves (radio-waves, wifi) reduce communication lag. Computing machines (processors) can be <a href="#machine-learning">taught</a> what patterns to look for. Computing machines also are more difficult to corrupt than humans.</p>
									<p><b>Superiority of techno-centralization:</b> Computing machines will gain efficiency (at processing information) faster than human counterparts around this time. Reasons including: Lower corruptability leading to lower concern about loyalty, thereby not needing to make compromises to ensure loyalty (privacy, lenience, policing). Superior communication irreplicable by humans. Superior replication of skill irreplicable by humans. All of the previous reasons resulting in higher dataflow, thereby better decision-making, increasing effectiveness of gaining effectiveness, among <a href="#dataflow">other benefits</a>.</p>
									<p><b>Centralizing tendencies of technology:</b></p>
									<h2><b>Consequences:</b></h2>
									<p><b>Decentralists and techno-denialism:</b> Decentralist-advocates faced with this development can: Change the thought. Deny the development. The latter increases likeliness of future denial of technological developments.</p>
									<p><b>Rise of dataism:</b> High amounts of information is required for techno-centralization to function (effectively). To gain information, processinh-power-holders can place sensors (cameras, cookies) to gather information. The processing-power-holders also have the opportunity of data-colonialism.</p>
									<p><b>Neo-totalitarianism and fall of liberalism:</b> Centralized effectiveness over decentralization allows already centralized systems to become more effective and influences non-centralized systems (pursuing efficiency) (to adopt centralization). Notably: Communism, a (common) user of centralized systems, will become more effective. Liberalism, a (common) user of decentralized systems will be less effective (compared to other systems). Fair exchanges in capitalism, a decentralized system (used by liberalism) will become unneccessary if everything (machines) aspires towards the same goal (transfer of resources based on relevance being superior).</p>
									<p><b>Higher interest in anti-machine tools:</b> When machines increase in importance (for the functioning of a system), having methods of compromising them becomes important (for competitors attempting to eliminate (or harm) opponents).</p>
									<p><b>Increased unity and pre-emptive activism:</b> Higher amounts of centralization (directly consequentially) reduce amounts of (differing) interests (motives). Results in less influence for those losing (decision-making) power, notably making <a class="tooltip">pressure<span class="tooltiptext">Use of threats (in this case disobedience (a form of punishment))</span></a> by human populations less influential. Allows power-holders to do (order) disliked actions (oppression) without significant (negative) consequence. Increases skepticism towards power-holders (in human populations over fear of committing disliked actions).</p>
