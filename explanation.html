Is a method of distinguishing <a class="tooltip" href="#good-vs-bad">good versus bad<span class="tooltiptext">In humanism, all which helps humans is good, all which does not is bad</span></a>. Widespread belief. Accomplished in varieties of different ways. A common method is increasing human <a href="#happiness" class="tooltip">happiness<span class="tooltiptext">A measure of wellbeing</span></a>. Most <a class="tooltip">moral goods<span class="tooltiptext">What is right and wrong</span></a> have a <a class="tooltip">form of humanism<span class="tooltiptext">Examples include: Nationalism prioritizing humans over animals. Humans eating animals but not humans. Humans helping other humans</span></a>.</p>
									<p id="happiness"><b>Happiness:</b> A measure of wellbeing. Commonly pursued goal. Commonly quantified as lasting <a href="#pleasure" class="tooltip">pleasure <span class="tooltiptext">Desirable sensations</span></a> or the absence of <a class="tooltip">suffering <span class="tooltiptext">Undesirable sensations</span></a>. <a href="#reality-changing" class="tooltip">Reality-changing <span class="tooltiptext">Changing the objective reality (moving an object)</span></a> and <a href="#belief-changing" class="tooltip">belief-changing <span class="tooltiptext">Changing one's subjective (perception of) reality</span></a> are methods of happiness-pursuit.

Commonly pursued by <a href="#humanism">humanists</a>. Solving <a href="#problems">the problems</a> is important when doing happiness-pursuit due to possibility of reduced consciousness through death, and reduced happiness through suffering-inducing environments, which could come from the problems.</p>
									<p id="reality-changing"><b>Reality-changing:</b> Changing the <a href="#universe" class="tooltip">objective reality <span class="tooltiptext">Status of any point/situation in the universe</span></a>. Usually to achieve a goal. Reality-changing is usually pursued by humans when feeling <a href="#dissatisfaction">dissatisfaction</a>. The extent of reality-changing is reflected by the <a class="tablinks tooltip"tooltip onclick="openCity(event, 'interest')" href="#interest">interests<span class="tooltiptext">Opinions, goals, values</span></a> of those pursuing it.</p>
									<p id="belief-changing"><b>Belief-changing:</b> Changing one's <a href="#consciousness" class="tooltip">subjective reality <span class="tooltiptext">Reality as experienced<span></a></span>. Usually to achieve a goal. Is a sort of reality-changing.</p>
									<p id="survival"><b>Survival:</b> Act of staying alive. Used to be dependent on good adaption. Is today dependent on ensuring needs-distributions. <a href="#infant-emotionalism">Semi-naturally pursued due to genetic coding</a>. Commonly pursued by <a href="#humanism">humanists</a>. Important to many happiness-pursuers due to consciousness being valued.</p>
									<p id="needs"><b>Needs:</b> Human requirements for survival. Includes: food, water, shelter, air, sleep. Survival is currently ensured by <a class="tooltip">capitalism<span class="tooltiptext">Relies on the interest of the resource-holders</span></a>, and is likely to being ensured once the resource-holders no longer have interest in <a class="tooltip">general human survival<span class="tooltiptext">Most humans being alive</span></a>. Loss of interest in human survival is a likely situation to arise from / is a part of <a href="#problems">the problems</a>.</p>
									<p id="entities"><b>Entity:</b> Refers to a set of <a class="tooltip">conditions/situations<span class="tooltiptext">Matter being at a certain location in reality for a duration of time. For example an arrangement of atoms in the form of a human on the earth for 80 years</span></a>, not necessarily in existence. Also known as party, group.

Extreme danger: <a href="#human-obsoleteness"class="tooltip">Human obsoleteness<span class="tooltiptext">Societies no longer requiring humans to function</span></a>. Major danger: <a href="#rise-of-centralization"class="tooltip">Rise of centralization<span class="tooltiptext">Centralized systems becoming more effective than decentralized systems</span></a>. Major danger: <a href="#return-of-conflict"class="tooltip">Return of conflict<span class="tooltiptext">Conflict becoming more effective than peace</span></a>. Major danger: <a href="#ecological-crisis"class="tooltip">Ecological crisis<span class="tooltiptext">The global ecosystem collapsing without an apprioriate response</span></a>. Major danger: <a href="#accidents"class="tooltip">Technological accidents<span class="tooltiptext">Accidents with technology capable of for example severly reducing the human population</span></a>. Minor danger: <a href="#natural-threats"class="tooltip">Natural threats<span class="tooltiptext">Asteroids and such can still strike the earth</span></a>. Minor danger: <a href="#anatomical-superiority"class="tooltip">Anatomical superiority<span class="tooltiptext">People being able to "upgrade" themselves to outcompete the "unupgraded"</span></a>.</p>
									<p id="human-obsoleteness"><b>Human obsoleteness:</b> Societies no longer requiring humans to function. <a href="#workplace">Workplace</a> and <a href="#decision-making">Decision-making</a> obsoleteness are the highest concerns.</p>
									<p id="rise-of-centralization"><b>Rise of centralization:</b> <a class="tooltip">Centralized dataflow<span class="tooltiptext">Concentration of information (and processing power)</span></a> and <a class="tooltip">centralized power<span class="tooltiptext">Concentration of authority/decision-making</span></a> in systems becoming more effective than decentralized ones. Centralization becoming more effective is due to the rise of <a class="tooltip">information-technology<span class="tooltiptext">Includes: computers for information-processing, information-gathering via cameras</span></a>, allowing many previous flaws of centralization to be solved. Includes: <a class="tooltip">limited processing power in individual humans<span class="tooltiptext">This encouraged dispersing the task of information-processing</span></a>, <a class="tooltip">bad communication<span class="tooltiptext">Long distances, language barriers, and lack of communication mediums, hindered communication. This made decision-making from far away ineffective, due to the information becoming outdated and was slow</span></a>, <a class="tooltip">corruptability of centralized systems<span class="tooltiptext">(systemic/imaginary) Invulnerability (in humans) encourages reckless and wasteful behavior. Dispersion of power decreases variation of power, thereby the feeling of invulnerability</span></a>. Advantages of dataflow makes <a class="tooltip">neo-centralization<span class="tooltiptext">Centralization with information technology</span></a> better at goal-achieving than decentralization. Centralization becomes more effective due to computers having better <a class="tooltip">'processing-power'-potential<span class="tooltiptext">You can have a billion chips cooperate without problem, but not a billion humans, as they are not made in the same factory. Chips also are a lot cheaper</span></a> and lower <a href="#corruption">corruptability</a> than humans. Obsoleteness of decentralization, contributes to <a href="#fall-of-liberalism">fall of liberalism</a>. Centralization is commonly found in authoritarian societies, which are commonly unwanted.</p>
									<p id="return-of-conflict"><b>Return of conflict:</b> Conflict, notably war becoming viable again. Innovation of <a href="#neo-arsenal" class="tooltip">counter-weapons<span class="tooltiptext">Reducing effectiveness of massdestruction weaposn</span></a>, new <a href="#neo-arsenal" class="tooltip">massdestruction-weapons<span class="tooltiptext">For example nuclear weapons<span></a>, and <a href="#dataism">dataism</a> cause this. Counter-weapons make previously <a class="tooltip">assured mutually-destructive scenarios<span class="tooltiptext">Scenarios where both parties are extremely likely to be at a loss</span></a> less assured. New massdestruction-weapons create new methods of extinction and war. An arms-race is encouraged by possibility of <a class="tooltip">meaningful destruction<span class="tooltiptext">Destruction helpful for goal-achieving</span></a>, and the possibility of enemies rendering weapons of the self obsolete, and effective elimination-tools. Arms-race creates weapons for <a href="#world-of-conflict">'world of conflict'-scenario</a>. Dataism is likely to cause a collapse of cooperation where information to be accessed, due to fear of <a href="#human-hacking">human hacking</a>. This results in <a href="#world-of-conflict">a dangerous, isolationist, brink-of-destruction, and desperate scenario</a>. Return of conflict can also cause increased cooperation as a method of survival. Cooperation would require high monitoring of both parties' actions, thereby integration, due to new-age arsenal's methods of quick and hidden elimination.</p>
									<p id="ecological-crisis"><b>Ecological crisis:</b> <a href="further.html#ecological-neglect">Human neglect</a> of <a href="further.html#ecological-collapse">ecological collapse</a>.</p>
									<p id="accidents"><b>Technological accidents:</b> Improper handling of dangerous technologies. Most concerning possibilities are: <a href="#ai">Hostile AI superintelligence</a>, Hostile <a href="#neo-arsenal" class="tooltip">nanites<span class="tooltiptext">Short for nanoscopic-entities</span></a>, and <a href="#nuclear-apocalypse">Nuclear accidents</a>. Preventable with thorough examination. Thorough examinations are difficult in realities with pressure; notably <a href="furhter.html#competitive-society">competitive society</a> and <a href="#world-of-conflict"class="tooltip">world of conflict<span class="tooltiptext">Many 'real-power'-holding entities becoming isolationist, brinkman-like and survialist</span></a>. Difficult to solve while <a href="#competitiveness">competitiveness</a> is rampant.</p>
									<p id="workplace"><b>Workplace obsoleteness:</b> The process of human obsoleteness in the workplace. Is happening due to <a class="tooltip">humanity<span class="tooltiptext">Act of being human-like. Includes having arms, brain, heart</span></a> not being <a class="tooltip">employable<span class="tooltiptext">Wanted by resource-holders</span></a>, <a href="#bio-vs-syn">humans not having (employable) properties unreplicable by other entities</a>, <a href="#anatomical-superiority">anatomical superiority</a> <a class="tooltip">(and biological engineering)<span class="tooltiptext">Act of changing carbon-based things. For example creating a dog with extra hair</span></a>, and <a href="#distance-of-the-future">development of correct technologies</a>. Increases the <a href="#growing-inequality">growing inequality</a> and allows for a <a href="#plutocratic-coalition">plutocratic coalition</a>. Obsolete individuals must rely on <a href="humanism">humanistic</a> <a href="#needs-distribution">needs-distribution</a>, due to the lack of <a class="tooltip">unprotected resources<span class="tooltiptext">Resources not claimed by a real-powerful entity</span></a>.</p>
									<p id="decision-making"><b>Decision-making obsoleteness:</b> The process of human obsoleteness with their decision-making. Is happening due to possibility of <a href="human-hacking"class="tooltip">Human hacking<span class="tooltiptext">Act of finding enough patterns in a human to predict, and thereby manipulate them</span></a>, and <a class="tooltip">availability of info-technology<span class="tooltiptext">Computers, cameras, processors. Info-technology is the tool for human-hacking</span></a>.</p>
									<p id="dataism"><b>Dataism:</b> A valuing of 'information and processing power', which is dataflow. Is practiced through <a class="tooltip">information-gathering<span class="tooltiptext">Surveillance, touching, seeing, feeling</span></a>, and <a class="tooltip">information-processing<span class="tooltiptext">Comparing, experimenting</span></a> to increase dataflow. <a class="tooltip">Commonly adopted due to assistance in goal-achieving<span class="tooltiptext">By processing more information regarding a situation, better understanding of it is developed, allowing better solutions</span></a>. Ruthless efficiency, thereby dataism, as a higher priority than trust of other entities can contribute to <a href="#return-of-conflict">return of conflict</a>. Is pursued during attempts at <a href="#human-hacking">human hacking</a>.</p>
									<p id="human-hacking"><b>Hacking of humans:</b> Act of finding and exploiting patterns in a human, thereby controlling them. Can happen due to <a href="#info-technology"class="tooltip">suffienct pattern-finding ability of info-tech<span class="tooltiptext">Enough useful patterns being found by dataflow units creatable with current resources</span></a>, and human decision-making being based on <a href="#material-process"class="tooltip">an understandable and interferable system<span class="tooltiptext">Decision-making is based on emotions, which is predictable and easily manipulateable</span></a>. Allows data-warfare: dataism regarding individuals to control them. Contributes to <a href="#return-of-conflict">return of conflict</a>. Those who know you can predict you. Those who can predict you can simulate you. Those who can simulate you can <a class="tooltip">control you<span class="tooltiptext">Knowing what situation to create in order to get a desired response</span></a>.</p>
									<p id="fall-of-liberalism"><b>Fall of liberalism:</b> The process of liberalism's <a class="tooltip">growing inferiority<span class="tooltiptext">Inferiority to centralized systems</span></a> and its replacement. Core ideas of liberalism no longer are viable: <a href="#liberalism">Liberal reliance on human <a href="#politics">political</a> and <a href="#economics">economical</a> value</a> makes the system ineffective when compared to some alternatives, most notably <a href="#techno-totalitarianism">technological dictatorships</a>, greatly contributing to the dissatisfaction with liberalism. <a href="#free-market">Capitalism cannot benefit humans when humans cannot benefit capitalism</a>, which can result in a <a href="#plutocratic-coaltition">plutocratic coalition</a>, is solvable due to capitalism mostly influencing values being used in the system. Human hacking can discredit democratic societies, potentially causing disuse of the technology, creating a disadvantage. Liberal collapse: Not abandoning liberalism leads to <a class="tablinks tooltip" onclick="openCity(event, 'hostility')"href="#hostility">outcompetition<span class="tooltiptext">Being outcompeted due to being disadvantaged</span></a>. People with emphasis for <a href="#survival">survival</a> and <a href="#happiness">happiness</a> over liberal loyalty <a href="#inflexibile-ideas"class="tooltip">(inflexibility)<span class="tooltiptext">Heeding to unbreakable fictional rules</span></a> will (gradually) abandon liberalism.</p>
									<p id="growing-inequality"><b>Growing inequality:</b> Distribution of <a href="#reality-changing">reality-changing</a> abilities and <a class="tooltip">luxuries<span class="tooltiptext">Things believed to increase happiness</span></a> becoming more concentrated. Is expected to increase due to reality-changing centralization becoming more effective and <a href="#workplace">workplace obsoleteness</a> decreasing resource-holders' dependence on humans, causing resource-holders to distribute less resources to humans. <a href="#growing-inequality">Anatomical superiority</a> can further increase inequality, due to being regarded as a luxury and capable of increasing labor power, thereby <a href="#hostility">outcompeting</a> the less powerful.</p>
									<p id="plutocratic-coalition"><b>Plutocratic coalition:</b> Resource-holders seeking to create a very exclusive global government. Distinct from resource-holders seeking to create a very inclusive global government. <a class="tooltip">Capitalist resource-holders<span class="tooltiptext">Rich people</span></a> are commonly observed as <a href="#evil-capitalists">ruthless, selfish, risk-takers, flexible, and efficient</a>. There is no reason for this to change. Continuation of past behavior can be a neglect or removal of useless entities like humans or unaligned entites like governments. Accomplished through <a href="#strike-method">strike-method</a>. This can cause extreme reduction in human population and higher <a href="#growing-inequality">inequality</a> before the reduction. Motivated by a <a href="#technological-paradise">promise of paradise</a> and <a href="#problems">the problems</a> being a threat while government are not working to solve them. Escaping to Mars would not be optimal, since the problems would still have to be solved. Potential members of a plutocratic coalition could be stopped and absorbed if given a <a class="tooltip">legitimate<span class="tooltiptext">Convincing</span></a> promise of the same.</p>
									<p id="statist-attempt"><b>Statist attempt:</b> A state attempting to create an exclusive global government. Unlikely to be done before <a href="#return-of-conflcit">return of conflict</a>, due to states not being known for technological pursuit. Exception is <a class="tooltip">China<span class="tooltiptext">Powerful entity</span></a>, which has an interest in <a class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'dataism')"href="#dataism">dataism</a>. A statist attempt will likely keep more humans than a <a href="#plutocratic-coalition">plutocratic coalition</a>, due to <a href="#vigilance">vigilants</a> having a higher chance to be part of a state.</p>
									<p id="disunity"><b>Disunity:</b> Global cooperation being needed to solve <a href="#problems">the problems</a> when cooperation is not enough and <a href="#return-of-conflict">expected to decline</a>. The <a href="#rise-of-nationalism">rise of nationalism</a> has been contributing to disunity. Is needed due to: <a href="#tech-regulating">Futility of local technological regulation</a>.</p>
									<p id="tech-regulating"><b>Technology-regulating:</b> Discussion regarding the consequences of regulating technology to some extent. Local regulations have possibilities of: <a class="tooltip">Example-setting<span class="tooltiptext">Can rouse dissent in others from moral supremacy and/or reminding or show willingness to cooperate, which could result cooperation</span></a>, <a class="tooltip"href="#competitiveness">Competition-losing<span class="tooltiptext">Disusing technology which could increase dataflow/productivity while an enemy uses it</span></a>, <a class="tooltip">Ineffectivness from too small share<span class="tooltiptext">Not having means to achieve a goal means the goal cannot be achieved. This includes example-setting and ecological mending</span></a>.</p>
									<p id="world-of-conflict"><b>World of conflict:</b> Many real-powerful entities becoming isolationist and desperate. All powerful entities are possible contenders. Is caused by <a href="#return-of-conflict">return of conflict</a>. Evolves exponentially with time passing. Isolationism is due to breakdown of cooperation due to fear of <a href="#human-hacking">human hacking</a>. Higher production results in more dataflow potential and superior weapon-creation of <a href="#neo-arsenal">usable weapons</a>. Entities with low production must use <a class="tooltip">extreme strategies<span class="tooltiptext">Preemptive strikes, reckless technological development</span></a> to <a href="#survival">survive</a>. Mutual destruction might be prefered over loss. Loss and surrender is also a subverting of will, due to human hacking.
