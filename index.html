									<p>Technology is significant and has always been. Today, in a world with more technology than ever, it is important to understand the true extent of its consequences.

									<h2 class="major">What</h2>
									<p>The goal of this site is therefore to give a greater understanding of the consequences of technology, in order for one to better react to them once they develop in reality. One can choose to remain unaware if one is at peace with the groups who are currently getting their hands on technology, like the youth, the governments, and the rich.</p>
