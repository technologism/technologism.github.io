									<h2><b>What happens:</b></h2>
									<p>Human means of achieving personal goals (survival, happiness) dependent on their ability to exchange resources (labor) for other resources (food, luxuries). Due to <a href="#obby1">how machines replace humans in work</a>, humans who have their resource-used-in-exchange made obsolete risk losing their means to achieve their interests (starvation, homelessness, poverty).</p>
									<p></p>
									<h2 id="obby1"><b>How it happens:</b></h2>
									<p><b>Current employability:</b> Human employability is primarily driven by two forces: Resource-gaining helpfulness, and beliefs of the employer. High resource-gaining helpfulness increases influence over resources, which is more means to use for competition over resource-influence, thereby gaining higher shares of influence over resources in the affected area. Resource-seekers therefore tend to seek resource-gaining helpfulness, while those who do not tend to hold less influence over resources. Beliefs of the employers, usually being the helpfulness in resource-gaining, affect likeliness of employment. Employers who's beliefs result in lowered resource-gaining effectiveness tend to have less resource-influence.</p>
									<p><b>Human mundanity:</b> The most relevant resources humans have are forms of labor. These are: Pattern-finding (knowing something about reality), moving of objects (changing reality), comparison of information (ability to memorize and compare information (to find patterns)), responding (action based on inputed information), sensing (gaining information from surroundings), transmission of information (talking), and being art (ability to trigger emotions).</p>
									<p><b>Machine abilities:</b> Human obsoleteness happens due to afformentioned human forms of labor all becoming doable by machines, while machines have additional qualities increasing resource-gaining helpfulness, causing outcompetition. Resource-gaining helpfulness qualities include: Electricity costing less (resources) than <a class="tooltip">wage<span class="tooltiptext">Resource(-influence) (money) given to humans in exchange for labor</a>, lower corruptability (no interests aside from those coded), and faster replication of skill (can copy code but not memories). Respective technologies replacing humans in all labor-fields are: {insert}. Even human selling of body(-parts) becomes obsolete too, due to replication-technology creating more desirable body(-parts).</p>
									<p><b>Question of emotion and art:</b></p>
									<p><b>Question of consciousness:</b> Insufficient understanding of <a class="tooltip">consciousness<span class="tooltiptext">The ability to experience</span></a> exists to determine whether it is a quality replicable by machines. Is lowly relevant for this discussion, due to little or no evidence existing regarding the ability to experience being required for afformentioned forms of labor to be doable.</p>
									<h2><b>Consequences:</b></h2>
									<p><b>Increased poverty and inequality:</b> The resources gained through automation will be go to the owners of the machines. Meanwhile, increased automation, transhumanistic technologies, and reeducation initiatives will be more available to those with many resources, resulting in the influential (rich) gaining more influence, and the uninfluential (poor) becoming less influential, per nation, per business, and per individual. Equality can be achieved if the resource-holders are willing to distribute them.</p>
									<p><b>Decreased dependency of resource-seekers on humans and Threat of a consphiracy against mankind:</b> Lowered usefulness of humans, means human willingness to cooperate becomes less concerning to resource-seekers (states, rich people). At the same time, humans can pose a threat to resource-seekers through attempts at increasing resource equality. Resource-seekers might therefore collaborate and succeed, due to also being influential resource-holders, to reduce human ability of interfering with the resource-seeker agenda (seeking resources). Such a reduction of human abilities might include mass-killing, mass-restrainment, and mass-'human-hacking'. This action can be considered ruthless and greedy, which resource-seekers have a reputation for being. Preventable through human relevancy (to the extent it is more difficult to instantly remove humans with few harmful consequences) and/or distribution of resources to entities more unwilling to compromise human abilities, or compromise human abilities to an acceptable extent. Reduced dependency on humans contributes to rise of centralization.</p>
									<p><b>Death of activism:</b> Humans having reduced influence results in lowered ability to change reality. Human obsoleteness in employability results in lowered resource-holding influence, lowering effectiveness of resource-disruption (beggars cannot go on strike). Human obsoleteness in military fields result in violent influence-gaining (revolution) having lowered chance of success.</p>
									<p><b>General technologist impact:</b> activism rise</p>
