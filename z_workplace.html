									<h2><b>What happens:</b></h2>
									<p>Human interests are currently secured by exchange-based fulfillment: Human <a class="tooltip">fulfillment-source<span class="tooltiptext">Source of means to achieve (personal) goals</span></a> dependent on their ability to exchange resources (labor) for other resources (food, luxuries). Due to <a href="#">how machines replace humans in work</a>, humans who have their resource of exchange driven obsolete risk losing their means to achieve interests (starvation, homelessness, poverty).</p>
									<p></p>
									<h2><b>How it happens:</b></h2>
									<p><b>Current employability:</b></p>
									<p><b>Human mundanity:</b></p>
									<p><b>Machine abilities:</b></p>
									<h2><b>Consequences:</b></h2>
									<p><b>Increased inequality:</b> The resources gained through automation will be go to the owners of the machines. Meanwhile, increased automation, transhumanistic technologies, and reeducation initiatives will be more available to those with many resources, resulting in the influential (rich) gaining more influence, and the uninfluential (poor) becoming less influential, per nation, per business, and per individual. Equality can be achieved if the resource-holders are willing to distribute them.</p>
									<p><b>Decreased dependency of resource-seekers on humans and Threat of a consphiracy against mankind:</b> Lowered usefulness of humans, means human willingness to cooperate becomes less concerning to resource-seekers (states, rich people). At the same time, humans can pose a threat to resource-seekers through attempts at increasing resource equality. Resource-seekers might therefore collaborate and succeed, due to also being influential resource-holders, to reduce human ability of interfering with the resource-seeker agenda (seeking resources). Such a reduction of human abilities might include mass-killing, mass-restrainment, and mass-'human-hacking'. This action can be considered ruthless and greedy, which resource-seekers have a reputation for being. Preventable through human relevancy (to the extent it is more difficult to instantly remove humans with few harmful consequences) and/or distribution of resources to entities more unwilling to compromise human abilities, or compromise human abilities to an acceptable extent. Reduced dependency on humans contributes to rise of centralization.</p>
									<p><b>Death of activism:</b> Humans having reduced influence results in lowered ability to change reality. Human obsoleteness in employability results in lowered resource-holding influence, lowering effectiveness of resource-disruption (beggars cannot go on strike). Human obsoleteness in military fields result in violent influence-gaining (revolution) having lowered chance of success.</p>
